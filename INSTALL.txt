Please read the copyright and license information before you proceed. This Maze code was developed by ForumOne and Gotham Gazette (http://www.gothamgazette.com) to create news games. You can visit some of the games created with the code by visiting http://www.gothamgazette.com/games.

This maze framework is database driven, and you'll need a reasonable interface to MySQL (the game has not been tested with any other database servers) to manage the levels, questions and responses for your maze game.

The very easy install is this:
* Create your database
* Import sample.sql
* Copy "application/config/database.php.sample" to "application/config/database.php" and add your database credentials
* Edit levels, questions and responses in whatever format suits you.

The odds are, however, that you'll want some sort of scheme for acutally managing the relationships between levels, challenge question and available responses.

We used an excellent and very simple database interface called BaseBuilder (https://sourceforge.net/projects/basebuilder)which was developed by the good folks at Mayfirst People Link (http://www.mayfirst.org). Jamie McClelland, to be precise. If you want to take the BaseBuilder route, you will need to do the following: 

* Create and populate a database to hold your game copy. We'll call it "examplemazeDB" for simplicity. There are many ways to create and populate a database. If you like command lines, here's one way:
	% CREATE DATABASE exampleMazeDB;
	% GRANT ALL ON exampleMazeDB TO `someuser`@`somehost` IDENTIFIED BY `somepass`;
* Install BaseBuilder somewhere on some server.
* Read the BaseBuilder instructions, which will walk you through adding exampleMazeDB to your BaseBuilder config file.
* Copy the layouts in "basebuilder_layouts" over to your basebuilder exampleMazeDB/layouts directory. 
* Pull basebuilder.sql exampleMazeDB. Note that "basebuilder.sql" assumes you've already walked through the Basebuilder setup. It won't create tables, just option lists and relationships.


Fun things:
* look through "application/config/config.php" for configuration options. Note that if you decide to turn on logging here, you'll want to make sure that your web server can actually write to the log directory!
* look through "application/config/database.php" for configuration options. 
* look through "application/config/maze.php" for configuration options.
